## Introduction

This document will provide an analysis of the University of Melbourne's course planner system.

For reference, the URL to the course planner is:

[University of Melbourne Course Planner](https://course-planner.unimelb.edu.au/)

## Features of the Course Planner

This section will describe the key features of the course planner.

### Entry Point

The entry point of the course planner allows you to create a new plan. Here, you have the ability to
select your course level (Undergraduate or Graduate), the course itself, commenced year and which
portion of the year you started (start or mid-way).

Since CourseFlow will be included as a feature of OnTrack, and students will therefore already have
an assigned course, these features present in the UoM course planner will likely be redundant for
CourseFlow in the near future.

### On Creation of Course Planner

This initial transition is important to capture as it will be relevant to CourseFlow and the
discussions around course templates.

On creation of a new course planner, an overlay window will appear and present a number of samples
that can be used to populate the course planner. For this run, Bachelor of Science was selected and
the samples covered numerous majors in different specializations such as Bioengineering and Data
Science etc.

Upon selection of Computing and Software Systems, the course planner was auto populated with units
associated with that major.

A similar feature was discussed for CourseFlow to auto-populate a new course map with core units for
a particular course.

### Main Page

The main page is similar to CourseFlow in terms of intended functionality. Here, users can see
course requirements, add/update/remove/move units and have them clearly grouped by the study period
and year.

Key things to note:

- Ability to select a slot (slot itself cannot be removed or added) and choose a unit.
- Slots are grouped by semester and semesters are grouped by year.
  - You can overload and add an additional slot.
- No indication of ability to add extra years. However, you can add additional semesters (for UoM,
  they are known as summer and winter term).
- Course requirements has a panel with subsections (accordions) and visuals to indicate if you meet
  that requirement or not.

### Subject Cards

These are the cards representing a subject.

Key observations:

- Heading to indicate if subject is compulsory, discipline specific or a breadth subject for the
  course.
- Other information also include subject code, level, credit points, name of unit and the semesters
  they are available in.
- Clicking the 3 dotted button will show more options such as details, change and remove.
- Visual indicator (in the form of an x) will tell users if rules of the subject has not been met.

Unit cards is a planned feature for CourseFlow with likely less information populating the cards.

### Detailed Subject Panels

This essentially provides a full description of the subject, along with assessment information and
subject rules (basically subject requirements).

Similar to the main page, there are visuals to indicate if you meet the subject requirements.

The key things to note:

- In cases where users have a choice of different prerequisite pathways to take, the system simply
  displays this in the rules panel and rules being met will update independently.
- Some subjects have VCE related prerequisite which is tracked manually by the user via a slide
  toggle.

Given the focus of CourseFlow will be on course planning and seeing if requirements are met for
course/units, it will not follow the same system here in displaying other information such as the
full description, coordinate information (equivalent to unit chairs) and assessment etc. Instead,
CourseFlow will utilize the unit information website and simply provide the link or embed the page
via an IFrame.

Requirements/rules of the unit for CourseFlow will still need to be displayed with progression
tracking.

### Subject Panel

Upon clicking the add a subject button, a window/panel will pop out and provide the user to select a
subject. The main thing to note regarding this is that you can filter subjects by level, study
period and area of study, with the toggles to only show breadth and/or discipline subjects.

Courseflow will be implementing a similar feature where users can filter units based on interest
areas. Additional filters can be considered.

## Data analysis

To help rationalize how this course planner works and relate it to CourseFlow to draw in inspiration
for CourseFlow's data modelling, an analysis of the data needs to be done.

Upon adding a subject in the course planner, json data is returned which can be used for this
analysis.

### Subjects Data

The key and relevant data include:

- Course planner itself with subject assignment with reference to a subject record id.
- Full subject information for the subjects that have been placed on the course planner:
- There is a published year and version field which might be a good way to keep track of different
  versions of a subject (2023.3).
- In terms of the subject data itself, one key thing to note that is going to be important for
  CourseFlow is the availability field that contains an array of JSON objects which detail
  information such as:
  - Campus
  - Mode of delivery (on campus etc.)
  - Study period (semester 1 etc.)
  - Period start and end date.
  - Year

### Requirements/Rules Data

In terms of subject requirements, it seems that this system keeps track of individual requirements
for a subject via the recordId. This also applies to the course requirements where it is tracked as
an individual entries via the recordId of the course.

Other key factors to note include:

- Each rule has a rule type such as progression, points constraint or count-constraint etc.
- Each rule has a section that the rule falls under such as pre-requisites.
- Some rules have a progress field that keeps track of information relevant to the rule.
  - For example, a count constraint for adding of two subjects into the course map will have a minimum, maximum and current count field where current count keeps track of those subjects being present or not.
  - In addition to this, there is a field for an array referencing each of those required units.
