## Introduction

This document will provide an analysis of the University of Melbourne's course planner system.

## Entry Point

The entry point of the course planner allows you to create a new plan. Here, you have the ability to
select your course level (Undergraduate or Graduate), the course itself, commenced year and which
portion of the year you started (start or mid-way).

Since CourseFlow will be included as a feature of OnTrack, and students will therefore already have
an assigned course, these features present in the UoM course planner will likely be redundant for
CourseFlow in the near future.
